### vmstd ###

A damon process monitors VMs network characters,
and reports statistical information periodly.

To make it works well, the following files should be exist:
`/var/vmstd/mac.list`
which includes (ether_addr, host) pairs.
`ether_addr` is ethernet mac address, eg. `00:16:3e:07:b2:80`.
`host` is the host name(the VM domain name).

And the statistic information is periodically reported in file:
`/var/vmstd/report.json`
